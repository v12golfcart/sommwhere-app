## Navigation Architecture

### Frontend Route Structure
```
/app
  _layout.tsx                    # Root layout with auth context + fonts
  index.tsx                      # Traffic controller for redirects
  
  /(auth)/                       # Unauthenticated flow
    _layout.tsx                  # Stack navigator with transparent headers
    login.tsx                    # Google OAuth + Apple (coming soon)
    /onboarding/                 # New user setup flow
      username.tsx               # Required: set username
      tasteProfile.tsx           # Required: wine preferences
  
  /(tabs)/                       # Main app (no wrapper)
    _layout.tsx                  # Tab navigator with icons
    capture.tsx                  # Default tab - wine capture (with camera/preview states)
    settings.tsx                 # User settings
    (activity.tsx)               # Activity feed - planned
  
  /analyze/                      # Wine analysis results
    index.tsx                    # Results screen with wine cards
  
  /(modals)/                     # Full-screen modals - planned
    _layout.tsx                  # Modal presentation config
    changelog.tsx                # What's new
    profile-update.tsx           # Update profile
    tutorial/                    # Multi-step flows
      _layout.tsx
      [step].tsx
```

### Key Navigation Decisions
- **Route groups** keep auth and app states clearly separated
- **No protected wrapper** - API handles auth, keeping structure flatter
- **Modals at root level** allows them to properly overlay tabs
- **Traffic controller** (`index.tsx`) handles initial routing logic based on auth state
- **Dynamic routes** (`[step].tsx`) for repetitive screens like tutorials
- **Onboarding subfolder** keeps new user flow organized separately from login

### Implementation Notes
- Use parentheses `()` for route groups that don't affect URL structure
- Modals group configured with `presentation: 'modal'` in root layout
- Auth state managed by Zustand store wrapped in root layout
- Deep linking scheme: `sommwhere://` configured in app.json
- API returns 401 for unauthorized requests, triggering re-authentication

## Authentication Plan

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo Router + Zustand
- **Backend**: Flask + Supabase (auth & DB)
- **Auth**: Dual authentication methods
  - **Primary**: Google OAuth (immediate availability)
  - **Secondary**: Phone authentication (SMS via Twilio - pending approval)
- **Token Storage**: Expo SecureStore (encrypted device storage)

### Authentication Architecture (Backend-Orchestrated)
The backend orchestrates the entire auth flow for security and consistency:

#### Google OAuth Flow (Available Now)
1. **Login Screen**: User taps "Continue with Google"
2. **OAuth Flow**: Frontend initiates Google OAuth â†’ receives ID token
3. **Backend Verification**: Frontend sends token to `POST /auth/google`
   - Backend verifies Google ID token
   - Checks if user exists in database by email
   - Creates/updates user record
   - Returns: `{isNewUser: boolean, session: {...}, profile?: {...}}`
4. **Frontend Routing**: Same as phone flow

#### Phone Auth Flow (Pending Twilio Approval)
1. **Phone Entry**: User enters phone number in frontend
2. **OTP Request**: Frontend calls `POST /auth/request-otp` â†’ Backend calls Supabase
3. **OTP Verification**: Frontend sends OTP to `POST /auth/verify-otp`
   - Backend verifies with Supabase
   - Checks if user exists in database
   - Returns: `{isNewUser: boolean, session: {...}, profile?: {...}}`
4. **Frontend Routing**:
   - New users â†’ Onboarding flow (username â†’ taste profile)
   - Existing users â†’ Main app with profile data

### Why Backend-Orchestrated?
- Single source of truth for authentication logic
- Backend can handle custom user creation/initialization
- Easier to add features (referral codes, feature flags, etc.)
- More secure - sensitive operations stay server-side
- Frontend only stores the final session token in SecureStore

### 401 Handling Strategy (Silent Refresh)
When the backend returns a 401 Unauthorized response:

1. **Intercept at API Client Level**: Global response interceptor catches all 401s
2. **Attempt Silent Refresh**: 
   - Call Supabase `session.refresh()` to get new tokens
   - This happens transparently to the user
3. **Retry Original Request**: If refresh succeeds, retry with new token
4. **Graceful Fallback**: If refresh fails:
   - Clear all auth state and SecureStore
   - Show toast notification
   - Redirect to login screen

This provides the best UX - most token refreshes happen invisibly, and users only need to re-authenticate when absolutely necessary.

### Unified Auth Flow
The app uses a single flow for both login and signup regardless of auth method:

**For Any Auth Method (Google or Phone):**
1. User authenticates (Google OAuth or Phone OTP)
2. Backend checks if user exists:
   - **New users**: Directed to onboarding (username â†’ taste profile)
   - **Existing users**: Directed straight to main app (tabs)

This approach eliminates user confusion about whether to "log in" or "sign up".

## Appendix: Wine Agent Architecture

### Overview
The wine analysis system is designed with flexibility and experimentation in mind. Instead of committing to a single AI agent implementation, we're building a system that supports multiple agent versions running simultaneously. This allows for A/B testing, gradual rollouts, and risk-free experimentation with new approaches.

### System Components

#### 1. Agent Registry (Central Hub)
- Maintains a catalog of all available agent versions (v1, v2, v3, etc.)
- Each agent has a version identifier and human-readable description
- Acts as a factory to create the appropriate agent on demand
- Enforces a common interface that all agents must implement

#### 2. Version Selection Logic (Traffic Router)
Determines which agent to use for each request, with this priority order:
1. **Developer Override** - API request headers for testing specific versions
2. **User Preference** - Saved choice from settings (beta testers only)
3. **A/B Test Assignment** - Automatic bucketing for experiments
4. **Default Version** - Fallback for all other users

#### 3. Wine Analysis Endpoint
A single API endpoint (`/analyze/wine`) that:
- Receives wine images and optional sommelier prompts
- Determines which agent version to use
- Routes the request to the appropriate agent
- Returns results with metadata about which version was used
- Logs all interactions for analytics

#### 4. Agent Implementations
Different versions of the wine analysis logic:
- **v1 (Single Agent)**: One AI agent that handles all tasks - simpler to build and maintain
- **v2 (Pipeline)**: Multiple specialized agents working together - more modular and debuggable
- **v3+**: Future improvements and experiments
- All versions follow the same input/output contract for compatibility

#### 5. User Experience Tiers

**Regular Users:**
- Take photo â†’ Get recommendations
- No awareness of versions
- Always get the current default or A/B test assignment

**Beta Testers:**
- Same photo flow
- Can access "Wine Analysis Engine" in settings
- Can switch between available versions
- Preferences persist across sessions

**Developers:**
- Can force specific versions via API headers
- Can query available versions via `/analyze/wine/versions`
- Can run side-by-side comparisons

### Benefits of This Architecture

**Development Benefits:**
- Build new versions without modifying existing ones
- Test in production with real users safely
- Easy rollback if issues arise
- Clean separation of concerns

**Business Benefits:**
- A/B test different approaches with real metrics
- Gather user feedback before full rollout
- Validate improvements scientifically
- Minimize risk of breaking changes

**User Benefits:**
- Stable experience for most users
- Power users can experiment with new features
- No disruption during upgrades
- Gradual access to improvements

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Single Version**
   - Launch with v1 as the only option
   - Establish baseline metrics

2. **Phase 2: Developer Testing**
   - Build v2 alongside v1
   - Internal testing via headers

3. **Phase 3: Beta Access**
   - Enable version picker for beta users
   - Gather qualitative feedback

4. **Phase 4: A/B Testing**
   - Small percentage gets v2 automatically
   - Compare metrics between versions

5. **Phase 5: Gradual Rollout**
   - Increase v2 percentage based on results
   - Monitor for issues

6. **Phase 6: New Default**
   - Make v2 the default
   - Keep v1 as fallback option

### Technical Implementation Notes

- All agents share the same base interface for compatibility
- Version selection happens at request time, not deployment time
- User preferences stored in database, not app
- Analytics track version usage for every request
- Feature flags control who sees version picker
- System designed to support 3+ versions simultaneously

This architecture essentially creates an experimentation platform specifically for our AI agents, allowing us to innovate rapidly while maintaining stability for users.
